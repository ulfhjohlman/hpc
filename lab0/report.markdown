## Download

First the installer was downloaded using `wget http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/plasma/pubs/plasma-installer.tar.gz` and extracted using `tar -zxvf plasma-installer.tar.gz`.

Then the `plasma_local` directory was created and the relevant files moved into it.

## Installation

Looking through the README and some testing revealed that inorder to install the library we needed to locate the blas and lapac libraries on ozzy. Some searching, for example using `find /usr/lib -name "*blas*"` led to the discovery of these directories.

For the actual installation the following was run in the `plasma_local` directory:
```plasma-installer_2.8.0/setup.py --cc=gcc --fc=gfortran --blaslib=/usr/lib/libblas/libblas.so --lapacklib=/usr/lib/lapack/liblapack.so```

The flags say which compilers to use, where the blas and lapac libraries are located, and not to do the testing automatically. When prompted whether or not to download tmg and the lapack c interface, yes was given as an answer.

## Tests

The tests were conducted by first running 'make' and then using `python plasma_testing.py` while in the `build/plasma_2.8.0/testing` directory. The tests were passed, except for a small subset which seems to be an issue with the preinstalled libraries on ozzy.

## Makefile

The makefile by default builds `all` which consists of `ztesting ctesting dtesting` and `stesting`. The `z- c- d-` and `stesting` files are declared to depend on their respective `testing_smain.h` header files and `SOBJ` macros. These OBJ macros are defined to be the .c files corresponding to each .o file in the SRC macros.

`clean` is defined to remove all object files including temporary files, while `cleanall` will also remove the EXE macro, which are the `z- c- d-` and `stesting` files. `clean` and `cleanall` are later correctly declared as phony targets.

It also includes the `../Makefile.internal` which defines a bunch of macros regarding directory locations of libraries and other common variables for the other make files.

`Makefile.internal` also includes `make.inc` which is autogenerated by the installer and defines additional macros, for example which compilers to use, as well as blas and lapack library locations which were given by the user during installation. It also includes the quark library directory which in turn has another `Quark/Makefile` to build the quark library, along with macros and clean definitions for this purpose.
